# Ironclad

**Ironclad** is a safety-first, deterministic agent core built in pure Python.

It is designed for production systems where **AI is allowed to plan, but never to act**.

No autonomy.  
No hidden execution.  
No magic frameworks.

## Core Philosophy

> **AI can decide. Python executes. Rules are enforced.**

Ironclad enforces strict separation between:
- **Planning** (LLM / AI – constrained)
- **Execution** (deterministic Python only)

Same input → same output.  
Every step is inspectable, logged, and auditable.

## What Ironclad Is

- A **library-first agent core**
- Deterministic and synchronous
- Safety-by-design
- Auditable and testable
- Suitable for analytics, fintech, security tooling

## What Ironclad Is NOT

- ❌ Autonomous agent
- ❌ Multi-agent framework
- ❌ LangChain-style orchestration
- ❌ Dynamic code execution
- ❌ AI-driven execution engine
